The list of 100 books which I quite personally think are the greatest in the history. This list is not completed yet (and probably will never be completed), and could be changed drastically based on the change of my personal values.

There are some exception rules:
- No "Collected Works" type books
- No Encyclopedia type books

The order of entries is not important.
